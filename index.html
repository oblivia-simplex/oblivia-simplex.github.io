        This should be fun: I'll be facilitating a workshop in
        cybersecurity for activists at the Halifax Public Library,
        with Quinn DuPont, in a few weeks. Check it out if you're in
        town. Here's the listing for Halifax Tradeschool:
        
        <h3>Title: Cybersecurity for Activists</h3>
        <h3>Saturday, April 2nd, 2pm</h3>
        <h3>Description:</h3>

        <p>This workshop will introduce tools and ideas for
        cybersecurity, privacy, and digital protections for activists
        and all concerned individuals. The workshop will engage an
        open, jargon-free dialogue about safe and secure ways to
        organize and communicate online, with a focus on practical
        applications. We will discuss a range of techniques and
        technologies, from the very simple to the highly secure, and
        we will discuss appropriate methods, and how to evaluate
        tools. Additionally, we will discuss offline approaches to
        security, and identify ways that social engineering can be
        avoided. We will discuss the challenges (and solutions) that
        particular communities encounter, including union and labour
        organizers; feminist, race and intersectional activists; and
        those working in communities in support/with differing
        abilities. This workshop is appropriate for all skill levels
        and all interests, and is targeted at a beginner level. A
        laptop computer is not required, although we encourage you to
          bring one.<p>

        I've been meaning to set up a homepage for a while, now. The trick
        to getting around to it, as usual, was to do it as a way of
        procrastinating something <em>else</em>. So,

        Content can wait. <br><br>
        
        PS: Thanks to <a href="https://www.alicemaz.com/">Alice Maz</a>
        for the nudge I needed to get this up, and for letting me plagiarize
        her layout. I really plagiarized the fuck out of that layout.
        (Psst, Alice, if you're reading this before I actually get around
        to asking you, is it cool if I rip off your layout? Yeah? Thanks.)
        Monospace fonts and a general absence of clutter, though, what can I say?
        There's really no other decent way of doing things. For a
        while, remember, it <em>almost</em> lured us all away from facebook.<br><br>
