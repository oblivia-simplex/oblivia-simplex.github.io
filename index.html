        <h2>INTRO TO CYBERDARWINISM</h2>

        <p>I've been thinking a lot about natural selection, lately -- not so
          much the "natural" side of it, as the way it works as a general
          algorithm. There's a long and enduring stream in AI research and
          development, called "genetic algorithms" (or, according to variations
          in method and history, "genetic programming", "evolutionary
          computation", etc.) that implements Darwinian selection as a way to
          evolve programmes that are fit to a particular task. It works
          extremely well when the task is intractable in the face of less
          stochastic programming methods -- typically, that is, when we're
          dealing with NP-hard problems.</p> <!-- salt with links to wiki,
        etc.-->

        <p>The basic idea is just this: evolution, following an abstract but
          effective Darwinian schema, only needs three things to occur:
          replication, variation, and selection. It doesn't need "life". It
          isn't even fussy about any particular properties of matter.
          Programmes, in fact, are <em>exemplary</em> candidates for evolution.
          (And you already know about memes.) It's possible -- in fact, it's
          easy -- to evolve programmes that are well-adapted to particular
          tasks, that find optimal solutions to problems, that fuzz out leaks
          and holes in software, that discover and exploit vulnerabilities,
          etc.</p>

        <p>This is actually something I work with,
          myself. <a href="https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/genlin">GENLIN</a>,
          over in my github repo, is a linear genetic programming
          engine, implemented in
          Lisp. <a href="https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/NeuroWorm">NeuroWorm</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/neuropong">NeuroPong</a>
          are a couple of toy implementations of the <a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">NEAT</a> algo, which
          I hacked together when I was just learning Python, a couple
          years back. They're scrappy and amateurish, but fun. Another
          project, a genetic ROP-chain payload evolver, is in the
          pipes, too.</p>

        <p>Classically, what you need to implement a genetic algorithm is
          this: <ul> <li>some way of selecting, out of a population of (intially
              random) programmes, candidates for reproduction <li>one or more
              "variation operators", emulating mutation or sexual reproduction, for
              example, for generating new programmes out of the programmes already
              in your population</li> </ul>

        <p>Selection is traditionally performed with reference to the
          "fitness" of a specimen, which requires you to quantify <em>how
            close</em> it comes to solving the problem you're interested in. For
          classification problems, this could be tied to accuracy, or detection
          rate, or whatever. For optimisation problems, it could be tied to
          efficiency. Coming up with a good selection method is usually the key
          to unravelling the entire problem. With that in hand, almost
          everything else falls into place.</p>

        <p>Once it's up and running, a genetic algorithm implements a form of
          "machine learning", or even intelligence. There's something wonderful
          about this. It's "Intelligent Design" turned on its head: instead of
          looking at the complexity of life and stubbornly insist in the face of
          Darwinian selection that there's some sort of divine "intelligence"
          behind it all, we take random, blind, natural selection, deploy it an
          absolutely artificial, virtual environment and exploit it <em>as</em>
          a form of machine intelligence! There's something sublime in this. It
          thrills the fuck out of me.</p>

        <p>Anyway, lately I've been studying ways of engineering
          <em>co-</em>evolution. Instead of measuring the evolving population
          against some static, a priori measure of fitness, you evolve the
          selection mechanism along with the population it selects from. You
          evolve it, for instance, as a second population, in tension with the
          first. Sometimes this is compared to the relation between
          <em>host</em> and <em>parasite</em> populations, or predator and prey.
          The parasite poses problems to the host, and itself has to adapt to
          this task. The host tries to solve these problems in return.</p>

        <p>There's many ways that this can go. The two populations can lock
          into an "arms race", each adaptation accelerating the evolution of its
          opponent. It's also possible for the two populations to collude,
          learning to pose as little challenge as possible to one another,
          settling into a sort of oligarchal mediocrity. An especially common
          outcome, however, is for the two populations to simply
          <a href="resources/parasite-gp.pdf">disengage</a>. This happens when the parasites and hosts lose any
          means of telling the counterparts apart, when a parasite, for example,
          has reached such an extreme state of virulence that every host is
          fails its tests in equal measure. Imagine, for example, two
          populations of pong paddles, where the left side has evolved to a
          point that it defeats every single right paddle with equal (and high)
          probability. At this point, whatever selective pressure that the left
          side imposed on the right is lost -- and vice-versa. The two
          populations enter a state that's known as <em>genetic drift</em>.
          Variation continues to occur, but it is now a purely stochastic
          process, a random walk. Adaptation has stopped, and any "intelligence"
          that the system might have exhibited gives way to a kind of
          free-floating delirium.</p>

        <p>This is where we're at.</p>

        <h2>RADICAL POSTURES AND MEMETIC DRIFT</h2>

        <p>It's pretty obvious that this is what's been happening in
          some (most) swaths of academic philosophy (something I've
          stewed in, myself, for a pretty long time). You have these
          entire discourses -- entire discursive populations -- that
          are no longer sensitive to <em>any</em> selective pressures
          from the outside. Discourses for whom the sciences are a
          sort of opaque monolithic block, and any talk about them
          dismissable as "scientism", and for which politics has about
          as little texture as a couple of opaque, featureless
          banners. What you get there is something that I suppose you
          could call "memetic drift": they're not
          exactly <em>stagnant</em> -- they're actually pretty lively
          and volatile -- but the way they vary is almost completely
          arbitrary. A random walk through academic memespace.</p>

        <p>This seems like a pretty good way of framing <em>disengaged
            political discourse</em>, too. I'm not talking about
            apathy or listlessness here. It's a state where a lot of
            impassioned romantics end up -- a self-styled "radical"
            posture that is so intense, so virulent, that <em>no
            adversary</em> can measure up to it. Everything is equally
            unacceptable. A sort of polarization takes place --
            between "left" and "right", for example -- but one that
            seems less and less like an actual struggle, and certainly
            has less and less of an effect on its environment
            (including, of course, its adversarial host).</p>

        <p>This is a pretty abyssmal situation situation for
          adversarial or minoritarian politics to find itself in.
          Feminism, for example, isn't currently poised to impose any
          sort of Unilateral Hegemony from above. Until the tables
          turn, it's best bet is to be a clever sort of parasite, one
          that can steer and redirect the evolution of its host. We
          need to be virulent, or we at least need to be virulent
          enough to avoid falling into the trap of collusion. There
          is <em>always</em> a risk of collusion, and if that happens,
          everything that counts is extinguished. And yet impatiently
          ratcheting up the virulence and shooting for a sort of holy
          radicalism can lead to pathetic abandon -- selective
          disengagement. Any chance of sculpting the adversary's
          political genome is lost, and a sort of delirious drift is
          all we'll have left.</p>

        <p>So, this is where I am these days: tinkering with AI, and
        working on my parasitism.</p>

        <h2 id="fuzoma">FUZOMA!</h2>
        <p>About a year ago, I was looking around online for some fun,
          sort of educational software that I could set up on an old
          beater of a computer for my kids. I
          found <a href="resource/FUZOMA16.ISO">this gem</a> (click to
          download iso). I was just about to add a link to it on my
          <a href="links.html">links</a> page, but saw that the site is
          (temporarily or permanently) down. Here's a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907052348/http://superkeen.com/peacecorpsweblog/learning-software/">snapshot</a> from the
          Internet Archive. What Paul Blair's done here is fantastic:
          it's a set of scavenged games, educational programmes, a chatbot, a text editor,
          and even
          an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPL0">XPL0</a>
          compiler, that <em>fits on a freaking floppy disk</em> and runs
          on pretty much any old box that wheezes. It's genius, really.
          Anyway, to keep this gem from dissolving into the ether,
          I'm going to host it here. Hopefully Paul Blair's cool with
          that.</p>

        <h2>CYBERSECURITY FOR ACTIVISTS</h2>

        This should be fun: I'll be facilitating a workshop in
        cybersecurity for activists at the Halifax Public Library,
        with Quinn DuPont, in a few weeks. Check it out if you're in
        town. Here's the listing for Halifax Tradeschool:


        <h3>Time: Saturday, April 2nd, 2pm</h3>
        <h3>Place: Halifax Public Library (Main Branch)</h3>
        <h3>Description:</h3>

        <p>This workshop will introduce tools and ideas for
          cybersecurity, privacy, and digital protections for activists
          and all concerned individuals. The workshop will engage an
          open, jargon-free dialogue about safe and secure ways to
          organize and communicate online, with a focus on practical
          applications. We will discuss a range of techniques and
          technologies, from the very simple to the highly secure, and
          we will discuss appropriate methods, and how to evaluate
          tools. Additionally, we will discuss offline approaches to
          security, and identify ways that social engineering can be
          avoided. We will discuss the challenges (and solutions) that
          particular communities encounter, including union and labour
          organizers; feminist, race and intersectional activists; and
          those working in communities in support/with differing
          abilities. This workshop is appropriate for all skill levels
          and all interests, and is targeted at a beginner level. A
          laptop computer is not required, although we encourage you to
          bring one.<p>

        I've been meaning to set up a homepage for a while, now. The trick

        for the nudge I needed to get this up, and for letting me plagiarize

        (Psst, Alice, if you're reading this before I actually get around
        to asking you, is it cool if I rip off your layout? Yeah? Thanks.)
        Monospace fonts and a general absence of clutter, though, what can I say?
        There's really no other decent way of doing things. For a
        while, remember, it <em>almost</em> lured us all away from facebook.<br><br>
