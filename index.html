        <h2>Qubes with StumpWM</h2>

        <p>I decided to celebrate the end of the semester in style, by
        installing Qubes on my laptop. It's something I'd meant to try
        out for a while, but which I never really got around to
        digging into. Qubes has
        some <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/hcl/">fairly
        idiosyncratic requirements</a>, but it turned out that my
        workstation (a T420s Thinkpad, with 8GiB of RAM and 300GiB of
        disk space, spread over two SSDs) already satisfied all of
        them, easily, despite being a relatively old machine (2011ish,
          I think). </p>

        <p>One of the initial hurdles for me, in setting up Qubes OS
        the way I like it, was the desktop environment. It's very
        nicely laid out, if you like KDE/XFCE with overlapping
        windows, but having been a bit spoiled by xmonad and, more
        recently, stumpwm, I found it a bit too busy and
          cluttered.</p>

        <p>I'm going to assume you already know the basics of what
        Qubes is and how it works, here. You can get a good rundown of
        all this on their website. The tl;dr is: Qubes is a Xen-based
        OS, which lets you compartmentalize various activities,
        applications, identities, etc. in separate, but efficient and
        seamlessly interacting, VMs, called "qubes". Typically these
        are Linux VMs, running Debian or Fedora, but I hear it's not
        hard to set up BSD or Windows qubes, either (haven't tried
        this yet, myself). The VMs, or qubes, or, in Xen's
        terminology, "domains", are administered from a master,
        bare-metal domain called "dom0", which is safely tucked away
        from any network connectivity, though it is able to request
        temporary connects through a gateway VM/qube/dom. The gateway,
        by the way, can be set up to do neat things like routing all
        traffic through Tor -- or, if you like, you can have *some*
        qubes route through Tor while others connect to the internet
        directly.</p>
        
        <p>Getting stumpwm, a very nice and customizable tiling WM,
        written entirely in Common Lisp, and benefiting from the
        wonderfully interactive, code-and-compile-on-the-fly
        environment that is Lisp, to run on Qubes wasn't too much
          hassle. Here's how it's done:<p>

          <ul>
            <li> open a dom0 shell, and install your preferred
              quicklisp-compatible lisp. For me, this is SBCL. You do
              this using dom0's special software update feature,
              which, the security conscious folks at Qubes remind you,
              ought to be used sparingly and cautiously. Enter the
              following at the prompt:
              <br><pre>sudo qubes-dom0-update sbcl</li><br>
            <li> now, install sbcl on one of your AppVMs (the
            user-level ones, where you do all your usual usery things,
            and which are typically connected to the internet is some
            fashion), and <a href="www.quicklisp.org/beta">download
                quicklisp</a>.</li><br>
            <li> open an SBCL repl, and enter <br>
              <pre>(load "quicklisp.lisp")</pre>
              from the directory where quicklisp.lisp resides.</li><br>
            <li> once quicklisp is installed, via SBCL (or CLISP, I
              hear, which works just as well), enter the following
              <br><pre>(ql:quickload :stumpwm)</pre></li><br>
            <li> Qubes
            <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/copy-from-dom0/">strongly
            advises against copying anything <em>to</em> dom0</a>, for
            perfectly sensible security reasons. But we're going to do
            it anyways.</li><br>
            <li> The easiest way to do this is to run the following
              command from the dom0 shell:
              <pre>
                qvm-run --pass-io &lt;name of AppVM&gt; \
                'tar cv -C /home/user ./quicklisp' | tar xf -
              </pre>
            This seemed like the sort of thing I'd want to do often,
            so I wrote a little script, which you might find handy in
            other circumstances as well. You can find
            it <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oblivia-simplex/dom0-utils/master/cpdir">HERE.</a></li><br>
            <li>go back to dom0, and mount /dev/sdc1, or whatever your
            USB partition is called, as you normally would in linux
              (without using qvm-block)</li><br>
            <li>copy quicklisp into dom0's user's home directory,
              because YOLO.</li><br>
            <li>open an SBCL REPL, and run
              <pre>
                (load "quicklisp/setup.lisp")
                (ql:quickload :stumpwm)
              </pre>
              to make sure everything works. Does it? Good. Now
            try <pre>(stumpwm:stumpwm)</pre>. If you get an error
            message about there already being a window manager active,
              you're golden, and ready for the next step.</li><br>
            
            <li>While you're doing all this, you might also want to
            grab <a href="https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm-contrib/tree/master/util/qubes">this
            nice little Qubes module for stumpwm</a>. Just copy the
            qubes directory in that repo to
            "~/quicklisp/local-projects/" on dom0. It will do nice
            things, like give your stump tiles borders that are
            color-coded by VM. This is handy for keeping everything
            disambiguated.</li><br>

            <li>The next thing you want to do is to get your display
            manager or desktop environment to use stumpwm instead of
            whatever it's using. I'm assuming you're using XFCE, and
            can't say for sure whether or not similar tricks will work
              for KDE. There are two ways of doing this: you can
            launch stumpwm directly from your display manager, or you
            can launch it from within the XFCE environment, while
            supressing XFCE's own WM. It's very nice of XFCE to let
            you do this, and it works surprisingly well. I recommend
            going this route, so that you can still get all the nice
            desktop goodies that Qubes put in there, like the menu
            bar, which lets you easily execute applications on
            different VMs, and the VM manager. If you'd rather go a
            more spartan route, and just learn how to do everything
              from the dom0 command line, that's doable to.</li><br>

            <li> First, we need a script to launch stumpwm from the
            command line (as opposed to the lisp REPL). That's pretty
              easy to do:<br>
            <pre>
              #! /bin/sbcl --script
              (load "~/quicklisp/setup.lisp")
              (ql:quickload :stumpwm)
              (stumpwm:stumpwm)
            </pre></li><br>
            
            <li> Make that script executable, and put it in one of
              your $PATH directories, like /usr/bin/, in dom0.</li><br>

            <li> Now you're ready to go and
            follow <a href="https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm-contrib/tree/master/util/qubes">this
            handy tutorial</a>, which shows you how to use StumpWM
            with Xubuntu. The process to use here is essentially the
              same.</li><br>

            <li> Create a .stumpwmrc file in your dom0 user's home
              directory, and add this line to it: 
              <pre>(ql:quickload :qubes)</pre>
              alone with any other configuration magic you like.</li><br>

            <li> If everything went according to plan, you should be
            ready to reboot, and log into your Qubes/StumpWM
              environment</li><br>

            </ul>

today, nor is it like the humanity that pierces iron. It is a humanity
in which relying on broken bones is farther than reachable, farther
than expected, farther than acceptable. Are wars , in which protesting
is part of are day to day life, in which tomorrow morning we'll be
expecting a riot in the streets, FALSE. Flamingos marching band,
flying penguins searching for shelter, they sing. We are the bumble
bees, and we are going to rid this world of DOMNI ROSELTO. We raise
the flags for children in a flesh rotting kingdom, for food that
poisons the mind, and an empire of twins slowly fading. Row from boat
to boat, a symbolic gesture for much more, many thoughts, and blue
          sky's.</p>

        <p>Seven braces, seven teeth, chewing home grown tomatoes, salads
box of green, shown only to a public domain of domestic caretakers,
lives of deception. Domni Roselto, violince on hand, as if eyes coated
in are past, life, lived, never forgot. A garden, creation slurped out
of a cup, on hold. I slip through his vents. “free the children, are
blond babies, red ruby dolls, and severe bruenets. On behalf of are

        <p>They scream hoping in return of a source forgotten.
Your child. The parents of a riot, and a protest on their

        <h2>QUICK + DIRTY INTRO TO CYBERDARWINISM</h2>

        <p>I've been thinking a lot about natural selection, lately -- not so
          much the "natural" side of it, as the way it works as a general
          algorithm. There's a long and enduring stream in AI research and
          development, called "genetic algorithms" (or, according to variations
          in method and history, "genetic programming", "evolutionary
          computation", etc.) that implements Darwinian selection as a way to
          evolve programmes that are fit to a particular task. It works
          extremely well when the task is intractable in the face of less
          stochastic programming methods -- typically, that is, when we're
          dealing with NP-hard problems.</p> <!-- salt with links to wiki,
        etc.-->

        <p>The basic idea is just this: evolution, following an abstract but
          effective Darwinian schema, only needs three things to occur:
          replication, variation, and selection. It doesn't need "life". It
          isn't even fussy about any particular properties of matter.
          Programmes, in fact, are <em>exemplary</em> candidates for evolution.
          (And you already know about memes.) It's possible -- in fact, it's
          easy -- to evolve programmes that are well-adapted to particular
          tasks, that find optimal solutions to problems, that fuzz out leaks
          and holes in software, that discover and exploit vulnerabilities,
          etc.</p>

        <p>This is actually something I work with,
          myself. <a href="https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/genlin">GENLIN</a>,
          over in my github repo, is a linear genetic programming
          engine, implemented in
          Lisp. <a href="https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/NeuroWorm">NeuroWorm</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/neuropong">NeuroPong</a>
          are a couple of toy implementations of the <a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf">NEAT</a> algo, which
          I hacked together when I was just learning Python, a couple
          years back. They're scrappy and amateurish, but fun. Another
          project, a genetic ROP-chain payload evolver, is in the
          pipes, too.</p>

        <p>Classically, what you need to implement a genetic algorithm is
          this: <ul> <li>some way of selecting, out of a population of (intially
              random) programmes, candidates for reproduction <li>one or more
              "variation operators", emulating mutation or sexual reproduction, for
              example, for generating new programmes out of the programmes already
              in your population</li> </ul>

        <p>Selection is traditionally performed with reference to the
          "fitness" of a specimen, which requires you to quantify <em>how
            close</em> it comes to solving the problem you're interested in. For
          classification problems, this could be tied to accuracy, or detection
          rate, or whatever. For optimisation problems, it could be tied to
          efficiency. Coming up with a good selection method is usually the key
          to unravelling the entire problem. With that in hand, almost
          everything else falls into place.</p>

        <p>Once it's up and running, a genetic algorithm implements a form of
          "machine learning", or even intelligence. There's something wonderful
          about this. It's "Intelligent Design" turned on its head: instead of
          looking at the complexity of life and stubbornly insist in the face of
          Darwinian selection that there's some sort of divine "intelligence"
          behind it all, we take random, blind, natural selection, deploy it an
          absolutely artificial, virtual environment and exploit it <em>as</em>
          a form of machine intelligence! There's something sublime in this. It
          thrills the fuck out of me.</p>

        <p>Anyway, lately I've been studying ways of engineering
          <em>co-</em>evolution. Instead of measuring the evolving population
          against some static, a priori measure of fitness, you evolve the
          selection mechanism along with the population it selects from. You
          evolve it, for instance, as a second population, in tension with the
          first. Sometimes this is compared to the relation between
          <em>host</em> and <em>parasite</em> populations, or predator and prey.
          The parasite poses problems to the host, and itself has to adapt to
          this task. The host tries to solve these problems in return.</p>

        <p>There's a few ways this can go. The two populations can lock
          into an "arms race", each adaptation accelerating the evolution of its
          opponent. It's also possible for the two populations to collude,
          learning to pose as little challenge as possible to one another,
          settling into a sort of oligarchal mediocrity. An especially common
          outcome, however, is for the two populations to simply
          <a href="resources/parasite-gp.pdf">disengage</a>. This
          happens when the parasites and hosts lose any means of
          telling the counterparts apart, when a parasite, for
          example, has reached such an extreme state of virulence that
          every host is fails its tests in equal measure. Imagine, for
          example, two populations of pong paddles, where the left
          side has evolved to a point that it defeats every single
          right paddle with equal (and high) probability. At this
          point, whatever selective pressure that the left side
          imposed on the right is lost -- and vice-versa. With
          selection no longer playing a role,
          as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift">genetic
          drift</a> comes to dominate the process. Variation continues
          to occur, but it is now a purely stochastic process, a
          random walk. Adaptation has stopped, and any "intelligence"
          that the system might have exhibited gives way to a kind of
          free-floating delirium.</p>

        <p>This is where we're at.</p>

        <h2>RADICAL POSTURES AND MEMETIC DRIFT</h2>

        <p>It's pretty obvious that this is what's been happening in
          some (most) swaths of academic philosophy (something I've
          stewed in, myself, for a pretty long time). You have these
          entire discourses -- entire discursive populations -- that
          are no longer sensitive to <em>any</em> selective pressures
          from the outside. Discourses for whom the sciences are a
          sort of opaque monolithic block, and any talk about them
          dismissable as "scientism", and for which politics has about
          as little texture as a couple of opaque, featureless
          banners. What you get there is something that I suppose you
          could call "memetic drift": they're not
          exactly <em>stagnant</em> -- they're actually pretty lively
          and volatile -- but the way they vary is almost completely
          arbitrary. A random walk through academic memespace.</p>

        <p>This seems like a pretty good way of framing political
            disengagement, too. I'm not talking about apathy or
            listlessness here. Disengagement can be passionate. It's
            even romanticised -- a self-styled "radical" posture that
            is so intense, so virulent, that <em>no adversary</em> can
            measure up to
            it. <a href="http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2014/11/everything-problematic/">Everything
            is equally unacceptabl</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07So_lJQyqw">e</a>. A
            sort of polarization takes place, but one that seems less
            and less like an actual struggle, and certainly has less
            and less of an effect on its environment (including, of
            course, its adversarial host).</p>

        <p>This is a pretty abyssmal situation situation for
          adversarial or minoritarian politics to find itself in.
          Feminism, for example, isn't currently poised to impose any
          sort of unilateral hegemony from above. Until the tables
          turn, our best bet is to be a clever sort of parasite, one
          that can steer and redirect the evolution of the host.
          Politics is a craft where your best tool is your adversary.
          <!-- a bit simplistic, I know. And, of course, there are
          many, many politically significant actions that can be
          achieved in a totally, or at least mostly, unilateral
          fashion. I've got endless respect for politically motivated
          DIY culture. I should expand on this later. Watch this
          space, source-peekers. -->
          But we need to be virulent, too -- virulent enough, at
          least, to avoid falling into the trap of collusion. There
          is <em>always</em> a risk of collusion, and if that happens,
          everything that counts is extinguished. And yet impatiently
          ratcheting up the virulence and shooting for a sort of holy
          radicalism can lead to selective disengagement. Any chance
          of sculpting the adversary's political genome is lost, along
          with any chance of adapting to the adversary's tactics. All
          that's left is a sort of delirious drift through the
          ether.</p>

        <p>So, this is where I am these days: tinkering with AI, and
        working on my parasitism.</p>

        <h2 id="fuzoma">FUZOMA!</h2>
        <p>About a year ago, I was looking around online for some fun,
          sort of educational software that I could set up on an old
          beater of a computer for my kids. I
          found <a href="resource/FUZOMA16.ISO">this gem</a> (click to
          download iso). I was just about to add a link to it on my
          <a href="links.html">links</a> page, but saw that the site is
          (temporarily or permanently) down. Here's a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150907052348/http://superkeen.com/peacecorpsweblog/learning-software/">snapshot</a> from the
          Internet Archive. What Paul Blair's done here is fantastic:
          it's a set of scavenged games, educational programmes, a chatbot, a text editor,
          and even
          an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPL0">XPL0</a>
          compiler, that <em>fits on a freaking floppy disk</em> and runs
          on pretty much any old box that wheezes. It's genius, really.
          Anyway, to keep this gem from dissolving into the ether,
          I'm going to host it here. Hopefully Paul Blair's cool with
          that.</p>

        <h2>CYBERSECURITY FOR ACTIVISTS</h2>

        This should be fun: I'll be facilitating a workshop in
        cybersecurity for activists at the Halifax Public Library,
        with Quinn DuPont, in a few weeks. Check it out if you're in
        town. Here's the listing for Halifax Tradeschool:


        <h3>Time: Saturday, April 2nd, 2pm</h3>
        <h3>Place: Halifax Public Library (Main Branch)</h3>
        <h3>Description:</h3>

        <p>This workshop will introduce tools and ideas for
          cybersecurity, privacy, and digital protections for activists
          and all concerned individuals. The workshop will engage an
          open, jargon-free dialogue about safe and secure ways to
          organize and communicate online, with a focus on practical
          applications. We will discuss a range of techniques and
          technologies, from the very simple to the highly secure, and
          we will discuss appropriate methods, and how to evaluate
          tools. Additionally, we will discuss offline approaches to
          security, and identify ways that social engineering can be
          avoided. We will discuss the challenges (and solutions) that
          particular communities encounter, including union and labour
          organizers; feminist, race and intersectional activists; and
          those working in communities in support/with differing
          abilities. This workshop is appropriate for all skill levels
          and all interests, and is targeted at a beginner level. A
          laptop computer is not required, although we encourage you to
          bring one.<p>

        I've been meaning to set up a homepage for a while, now. The trick
        to getting around to it, as usual, was to do it as a way of
        procrastinating something <em>else</em>. So,

          .._.._....._._........................_...._....

          .|_||_\___|_|_\___( )  \_/\_/\___/_| |_\__,_(_).
          ..................|/............................
        </pre>

        Content can wait. <br><br>

        PS: Thanks to <a href="https://www.alicemaz.com/">Alice Maz</a>
        for the nudge I needed to get this up, and for letting me plagiarize
        her layout. I really plagiarized the fuck out of that layout.
        (Psst, Alice, if you're reading this before I actually get around
        to asking you, is it cool if I rip off your layout? Yeah? Thanks.)
        Monospace fonts and a general absence of clutter, though, what can I say?
        There's really no other decent way of doing things. For a
        while, remember, it <em>almost</em> lured us all away from facebook.<br><br>
